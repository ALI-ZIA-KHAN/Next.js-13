Next.js 13 Thapa

In public your photos will be there
In app folder you can have your server components(that can directly talk with server)
In Layout.js -> The the children is what being rendered and that comes from page.js(this is your main page)
global.css where your all css would be

Added styles folder having cass files in App folder
Then suppose u wannt about page u create about folder and inside it created page.js(it will be same like index,js)  
now in your browser when u write /about u can see that page

While creating a project it was asking of @ that refers to src
when we import anything like @/app means src/app

Everything in next.js is componet like u have to import Image compoent from Next
also Link , now u just give href in in it no <a> tag

In image height and width must be given

in global.css write only thatcss which you want to effect globally


Auto support of google fonts, fonts can be use in layoutt so to apply in whole


In order to create a dynamic route for example unique movies details 
like movies/1de

so for that inside movies folder create a folder with sq brackets like [id] and inside it then page.js ->
this is known as slug(dynamic routing)


In order to add network images u need to add domain name in next.config.js


take id from params to fetch details of particular movie

create a file called loading.js and anything u make there it will be serve as loader bfrevery page gets load

just to halt any async func or component for 2 second added this  line to show loader

await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

for 404 page just make not-found.js file and u r done but at that time due to beta version styles weren't applied

there are different ways to style as well if in any className there is - then you can use style like styles 
className={heroStyles['custom-shape-divider-bottom-1681647578']}


For example if you want to have style of contact or any other page within its folder then u can have, 
so its style will only remain till its page , meanwhile u can have components ccss in global

client vs server

fetching, database connection ->server
hooks like useState, class components ->client

see the documentation


for database connection

create a utils folder on same level of app
then any js file annd paste code what is given by thapa
basically it prevents the new connection if there exist already so we use power of cache for that


then create models folder on same level
and create scehma file inside it
and create model of it

Next
ap backend to hai nhi  k express se api bnae

Then POST ki request thi to isme body jo arahi use bi req.json() krna hai
phir b conn krwaen
Jo response hm send krte the usk lie NextResponse.json() krk hoga


then in form component do write the submit function

also in next.config,js add       serverComponentsExternalPackages: ["mongoose"],
